1. We cannot annotate our genes until we know the source and build of the reference files that were used in the analysis upstream of obtaining the pseudocounts.
	
	1. True
	1. False

1. Which of the following statements about AnnotationHub are NOT TRUE?

	1. AnnotationHub is a resource for accessing genomic data or querying large collection of whole genome resources, including ENSEMBL, UCSC, ENCODE among many others.
	1. In AnnotationHub Ensembl and Entrez identifiers have a one-to-one mapping.
	1. AnnotationHub allows us to retrieve gene, transcript and exon-level information.
	1. When searching Human EnsemblDb using AnnotationHub, there are older releases but only for the most recent build.

1. True/False. Among the functional analysis methods, GSEA is better than over-representation analysis for exploring enriched processes or pathways when there are few differentially expressed genes.

	1. True
	1. False

1. True/False. We identify RNA splicing-related terms as significant in both our over-representation and GSEA analyses. We can conclude that RNA splicing is affected by our condition of interest.

	1. True
	1. False
